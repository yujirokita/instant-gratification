# Instant Gratification
This is the xth place solution.

## Push/Commit via API
To push and commit a kernel, execute a command below in `script` ([Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is required).
```bash
python push.py kernel-name.py
python push.py kernel-name.ipynb
```
This is usefull, because the competition is a synchronous kernels-only competition.
